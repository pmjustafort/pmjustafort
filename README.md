### Hello, World! üåç I'm Paul Justafort.

With over a decade of experience in civil engineering, I have spent the past year honing my skills in data science, combining my background with modern computational techniques to solve real-world problems. I have completed several projects that reflect my passion for both fields and my drive to deliver data-driven solutions.
